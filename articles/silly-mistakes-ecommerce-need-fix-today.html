    "articleSection" : "It still surprises me to see websites make these mistakes. In a digital age where first impressions mean absolutely everything, you need to make sure your site is not repulsing potential customers, driving them to your competition and losing you sales. 1 - Untrustworthy / Low-Quality Design The most common mistake I see amongst eCommerce sites is a visually unappealing and generally poor site. A visually unappealing or low-quality site when amongst well designed, visually appealing sites of competitors it is obvious that the customer will go somewhere else. This is because the lack of quality indicates low effort or lack of skill. This then tarnishes the site causing the customer to leave and likely not to return. Particularly for small and newer sites with fewer reviews it is paramount to have trust and reliability with your potential customer base. I cannot begin to count how many times I have been to an online store and been put off by their low quality and lack of site investment. 2 - Poor Usability A shorter sales process correlates with a higher rate of sales. Time gives a customer the opportunity to rethink their decision to purchase a product. An overly complicated layout accompanied by a long-winded checkout acts almost as a deterrent to impulse purchases due to the amount of additional effort required to complete the sale. If the customer leaves before checkout they have either changed their mind about the product or are finding another, simpler, site. Google reported 73% of consumers will switch from a poor mobile site to a better one which makes purchasing easier, which leads us to… 3 - A Broken Mobile Site Do not ignore your mobile site and forget to test it. There have been too many occasions where I close the site in frustration on my phone from a site that is buggy and irresponsive. Some 44.7% of sales are completed on a mobile phone, and this number is predicted to grow to a number just shy of 50% by the end of the year. Do not miss out on customers due to easily fixable errors. 4 - Lack of Attention to Detail or a Rushed Site Spelling mistakes. Poor grammar. Lack of finishing touches. I believe the first indicator of proper maintenance is a site which has an up-to-date footer. I cringe each and every time I see a site display an outdated year in its footer at the bottom of the page, along the lines of “ExampleSite.com © 2018”. Unless you are selling time machines, make sure you keep your footer up to date. Not only does this show you have poor attention to detail, but it also sparks a lack of trust amongst customers by allowing them to question ‘what else is this company not doing properly?’. Do not give them doubt. Triple check your site has no silly errors present. Read over your entire site. Summary Get a second pair of eyes. Have someone use your site who you know has not visited it before. If it is not simple, fast and easy then think about reducing complexity. Test it on as many devices as you can and make sure to check for signs of neglect and poor maintenance. Fix these errors today and don’t miss out on more sales. Instagram Stories have proven to be a great way of getting engagement, and building your email list is no different. Any account with at least 10,000 followers will get access to the feature enabling them to add links to their stories which will be displayed as “See More” at the bottom of the story. So if you have access to this feature, share a link to your sign up page, and remember to add a call to action (CTA) to improve conversions such as “Swipe Up!” or “Subscribe Now!” ",

          It still surprises me to see websites make these mistakes. In a digital age where first impressions mean absolutely everything, you need to make sure your site is not repulsing potential customers, driving them to your competition and losing you sales.
